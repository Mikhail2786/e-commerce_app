## My process

- This is my first react project. I decided i would learn react with a few udemy courses, however, instead of doing the uemy projects, i decided to get straight into the Frontend Mentor challenge: e-commerce peoject via The Learning People. This is very much a learn as i go project.

- I started of with mobile first layout, then tablet, and then a desktop layout. I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to understand what the layout would look like on each device.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
  - Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

While building this project, i have learnt the following:

### React.js

- JSx
- Functional components
- Hooks such as useState & useEffect aswell as building custom hooks
- useContext and many more React related features.

### CSS

- CSS Grid

I also learnt that it is always important to plan the structure of your project regardless if you have been presented with the designs.

### Continued development

I will continue you to develop in all areas such as css, javascript and react. I will also strengthen my frontend skills by learning redux and typescript.
